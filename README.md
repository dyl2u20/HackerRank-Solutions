# HackerRank Solutions

This repo is for all my solutions on HackerRank, I attempt to solve at least solve one problem daily.
I have great fun on HackerRank solving problems and learning of new approaches to such problems.

## Languages used

* C#
* Lua
* Ruby

I primarily use C# in my solutions.

## Disclaimer

While readabilty should always come first when it comes to writing code, I have not applied this for several of my solutions, particularly in C#.
This is a result of me trying to successfully solve a problem with as few lines as possible, primarily aiming for "one-liner" solutions. 
I have a lot of fun trying to solve problems this way, especially in C# as it is a very verbose language.
